# Basic information

-   Title: Bayesketball: comparing hierarchical bayesian prediction of basketball win probabilities to machine learning models.
-   Team Members:
    -   Prithaj Nath
    -   Nate Borland
    -   Fitz Koch

# Learning Objectives

    Note: should be different for each team member.

# Project idea

"One section outlining the project idea. This section should be a paragraph or two."

## Pitch

The idea is to hierarchically model basketball with Bayesian priors and posteriors. The goal will be to build probability distribution for any two teams facing each other, and thus predict the outcome of the league (and each team), both with historical data and with present data. These models will then be compared with machine learning models.

## Hierarchy

Proceeding 'down' to our original priors, something like this:

1. Win probability = comparison of team quality.
2. Team quality = player quality (scaled by expected playing portion)
    1. Player quality: based on stats, such as :
        - assists
        - rebounds
        - shots attempted
        - percentage shots scored
        - and so on.
    2. Expected playing time: based just on by their previous playing time (with injury = removed from team, not no playing time)
